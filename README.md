# embla-ecs
A little ECS for little games, made to be used with wasm

It is intended to be used for small jam-style games, and specifically for wasm projects.As such, the focus is not primarily on performance, but on providing a simple API that's easy to iterate with.

## embla-ecs should be:
 * Simple to use
 * Single-threaded
 * Reasonably performant

## embla-ecs is *not* intended to be:
 * as featureful as other more mature ECS libraries
 * as performant as other ECS libraries
 * multi-threaded (until supported by wasm)
